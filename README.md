scharrier dotfiles (from thoughtbot ones)
=========================================

Requirements
------------

Set zsh as your login shell:

    chsh -s $(which zsh)

Install
-------

Clone onto your laptop in `$HOME/Dev`:

    git clone git://github.com/scharrier/dotfiles.git

Install [rcm](https://github.com/thoughtbot/rcm):

    brew tap thoughtbot/formulae
    brew install rcm

Install the dotfiles:

    env RCRC=$HOME/Dev/dotfiles/rcrc rcup

This command will create symlinks for config files in your home directory.
Setting the `RCRC` environment variable tells `rcup` to use standard
configuration options:

* Exclude the `README.md` and `LICENSE` files, which are part of
  the `dotfiles` repository but do not need to be symlinked in.
* Give precedence to personal overrides which by default are placed in
  `~/dotfiles-local`

You can safely run `rcup` multiple times to update:

    rcup

Make your own customizations
----------------------------

Put your customizations in dotfiles appended with `.local`:

* `~/.aliases.local`
* `~/.git_template.local/*`
* `~/.gitconfig.local`
* `~/.gvimrc.local`
* `~/.psqlrc.local` (we supply a blank `.psqlrc.local` to prevent `psql` from
  throwing an error, but you should overwrite the file with your own copy)
* `~/.tmux.conf.local`
* `~/.vimrc.local`
* `~/.vimrc.bundles.local`
* `~/.zshenv.local`
* `~/.zshrc.local`
* `~/.zsh/configs/*`
